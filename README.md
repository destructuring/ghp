# git home page

An opinionated way to document your git projects:

- Markup: Markdown everywhere
- Hosting: generated static site hosted on a web server or local folder
- Start at the README (which is also the index.html)
- scripts have --help and man pages
- code documented with rocco, shocco
- documentation lives with code but generated site can be another git
  repo/branch
